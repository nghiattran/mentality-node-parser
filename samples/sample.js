/* 
@form Node
@desc Dense implements the operation: output = activation(dot(input, kernel) + bias) where activation is the element-wise activation function passed as the activation argument, kernel is a weights matrix created by the layer, and bias is a bias vector created by the layer (only applicable if use_bias is True).

@input    units
@type     number
@required true
@step     0
@min      1
@desc Positive integer, dimensionality of the output space.

@input activation
@type     text

@desc     Activation function to use (see activations). If you don't specify anything, no activation is applied (ie. "linear" activation: a(x) = x)
